# GameKnight
GameKnight is passion project I began work on during my time at Prime Digital Academy. It's purpose is to streamline the event scheduling process and minimize the amount other apps, websites a group of friends would need to gee that date planned.

Duration: Initially a 2.5 week sprint/ continuous work post base completion.

# Main problems solved:
- Simple form used to invite via user and/or email (api planned.)
- Simple form to add games to a user account.
- Ability for a user add/remove events/games.
- Ability for a user to add games from their list to an event they've either created or apart of.
- Chat features unqiue to each event. (local client side planned, saves db issues.)

## Visuals
On the Way!

#### Software Requirements (Assuming a Mac is used.)
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- ReactJS (https://reactjs.org/)
- Postgres (pg)
- Gmail Api (planned)
- Google Maps Api (planned)
- A full list of the dependecies can be found  in the package.json file. These will be installed by running 'npm install' after downloading the repository and navigating to the folder in your test-editing software.

##### Usage and Installation
1. Fork from master on the repository, or, download/ clone the repository link.
2. In your coding program, open terminal and run: 'npm install'
3. Set up your database and name it ''. (WIP)
5. Spin up server: 'npm run server'
6. In a separate terminal, fire uop your client: 'npm run client'.
7. By default, web page is set to default 'localhost:3000/' If errors, double check your port is set to 3000.
8. Enjoy!
